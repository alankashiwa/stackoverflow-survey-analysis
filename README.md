# A Brief Exploration of Country Difference Based on Stack Overflow Developer SurveyÂ 2018

## 1. Project Motivation
The idea of working in another country as a software developer has always excited me. This project, which is part of [Data Science Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025), gave me a chance to explore and answer the questions regarding working in another country.

## 2. Packages Used
The following packages are required to execute the code in the jupyter notebook. They all come with the [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
* numpy 
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn

## 3. Data Source
The dataset for this analysis is from [Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey 2018](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey)

## 4. Questions in Interest
1. What is the relative popularity of technologies(languages, frameworks, and platforms) in each country?
2. What are the converted salaries in each country along with the cost of living?
3. What are the factors for job satisfaction?
